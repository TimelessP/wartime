# Timeless Prototype's WarTime - Game Rules

## Setting up a new game

Set aside an area of your table which will act as the "Bank". All pieces and cash are placed in the bank. Cash is common
to all players, but players will only have access to pieces belonging to the player's chosen piece colour.

Each player chooses a colour, and places one of each of the following:

- Command Centre
- Bulldozer next to the Command Centre
- Oil well
- Plus Disc Holder

The game is ready to play.

## Playing a turn

### Income from Oil Wells and Oil Storage units in play

At the start of each turn, if there's enough cash in the bank (giving change for higher denominations is allowed), the
bank gives 100 cash to the player for every Oil Well and/or Oil Storage piece the player has on the table.

### Piece selection and action

The player chooses a piece and states what action it's taking (see reference section below). Some actions require a d6
roll, measuring stick, or none of the above.

Note that an attack on a fortified building first destroys the fortification, and then another turn is needed to destroy
the building itself.

Fortified buildings cannot be captured until the fortification is destroyed - you cannot capture fortifications.

### Extra turns in the same turn

If the player chooses to spend a Plus Disc, they make take another turn within the same turn. The player must already
have the Plus Disc in their Plus Disc Holder in order to take another turn. A maximum of four Plus Discs can be spent in
this way if the player has that many already to spend.

### Reward

If any successful attacks (not moves, nor captures, etc.) were made during the turn, only one Plus Disc is given to the
attacking player from the Bank, unless there are no more Plus Discs of the player's colour remaining in the Bank.

### End of game or turn

A player exits the game if all their pieces are destroyed or captured.

The last player remaining in the game wins.

When the player's turn ends, then the next player's turn begins.

## Reference - general actions

### Moving a piece

### Attacking with a piece

### Capturing with a piece

### Embarking or disembarking a piece

### Building or selling a piece, and price list

When building a piece using the bulldozer, the piece must be placed touching the bulldozer.

After a piece is sold (to the Bank only), it is removed from the table and placed back into the Bank, and is then
available for purchase again later.
